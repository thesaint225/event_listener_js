Fetch Data with Promises
Create a function fetchUserData() that returns a Promise simulating fetching user data from an API. Use setTimeout to delay the response for 2 seconds, and resolve it with a user object (e.g., {name: 'John', age: 25}).
Bonus: Handle both success and failure scenarios by rejecting the Promise if the API call fails.
