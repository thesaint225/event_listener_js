Simple Callback Execution
Write a function doHomework(subject, callback) that takes two arguments: a subject (string) and a callback function. The callback should be executed after printing the subject.

Steps:
Print "Starting my homework on [subject]".
Then, execute the callback to print "Finished my homework!".
