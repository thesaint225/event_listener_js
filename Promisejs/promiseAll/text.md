Promise.all() with Multiple API Calls
Simulate three API calls with Promises: fetchPosts(), fetchComments(), and fetchLikes(). Each function should return a Promise that resolves after a short delay (using setTimeout) with some data.
Use Promise.all() to wait for all three API calls to complete, then log the combined result.
