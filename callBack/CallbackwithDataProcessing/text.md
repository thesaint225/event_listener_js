Create a function fetchData(callback) that fetches some data (simulate using a simple array). Once the data is ready, call the callback and pass the data to it.

Steps:
Use an array like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
After a short delay (e.g., 2 seconds), pass the array to the callback function that prints the data.
